%!	thelma_tpc(+Pos,+Neg,+BK,+Metarules,-Program) is det.
%
%	Use Thelma to construct a Top Program for a set of Targets.
%
%	This is a version of the Top Program Construction algorithm
%	(TPC) implemented by means of Thelma, itself an implementation
%	of Metagol.
%
%	The main difference between Thelma (Metagol) and TPC is that
%	Metagol constructs a hypothesis by proving the conjunction of
%	the positive examples while TPC constructs each clause in
%	isolation. There are tradeoffs between the two methods, most
%	notably the efficiency of TPC and the ability of Metagol to
%	learn multiple, dependent clauses from a single example, such as
%	the clauses of a recursive program.
%
%	This predicate implements TPC as a variant of Metagol that
%	learns a Top Program by nondeterministically running Thelma's
%	meta-interpreter on each example. Constructing a Top Program in
%	this way takes advantage of Thelma's ability to learn complex
%	programs with dependent clauses from single examples, while
%	preserving some of the efficiency of TPC.
%
%	TPC is efficient because it avoids a search of the MIL
%	Hypothesis Space, that can grow very large when the target
%	theory is large and when there are many competing hypotheses
%	that resemble the target theory. Thelma learns by searching the
%	Hypothesis Space, but training it on a single example at a time
%	keeps the Hypothesis Space to a manageable size, more often than
%	not. Yet, there are no guarantees and there are going to be
%	problems for which the Hypothesis Space increases at an
%	exponential rate (exponential to the number of constructible
%	clauses) even given a single example.

%
%	Explanation
%	===========
%
%	Thelma performs an iterative deepening search for a _hypothesis_
%	that explains its training examples.
%
%	A hypothesis is a list of definite datalog clauses that may
%	include definitions of one or more invented predicates. The
%	depth of the search at each iteration corresponds to the _size_
%	of the hypothesis, defined as the number of all clauses in the
%	hypothesis.
%
%	This predicate is responsible for controlling the depth of the
%	search by incrementing the values of Clauses and Invented.
%
%	Clauses is the maximum hypothesis size at the current search
%	depth. Invented is the maximum number of clauses in all invented
%	definitions in the hypothesis at the current search depth.
%
%	Clause_Max and Invented_Max are the maximum number of all
%	clauses in the hypothesis and the maximum number of all clauses
%	of invented predicates in the hypothesis, in the entire search.
%
%	Clauses and Invented are first bound to Clauses=1, Invented=0
%	and then to that number plus 1 on each successive backtracking
%	into depth_level/4. The search exits without further
%	backtracking when Clauses is equal to Clause_Max and Invented
%	equal to Invented_Max, or when no more hypotheses can be found.

%!	program_signature(+Invented,+Target,+BK,-Predicates,-Constants)
%!	is det.
%
%	Construct the program signature for a learning attempt.
%
%	The _program signature_ is a list of predicate symbols that can
%	be used to form a hypothesis. This list consists of:
%	a) The symbol and arity of the target predicate, at its head.
%	b) The symbols and arities of invented predicates, following.
%	c) The symbols and arities of background predicates ordered by
%	lexicographic order, at the end.
%
%	Invented is the maximum number of all clauses in invented
%	definitions in a hypothesis in the current search depth.
%
%	Target is the symbol and arity of the target predicate.
%
%	BK is a list of symbols and arities of predicates to be used as
%	background knowledge for Target.
%
%	Predicates is the program signature. The order of symbols and
%	arities of background knowledge predicates in BK is ordered by a
%	call to order_constraints/3.
%
%	Constants is the list of constants in the Herbrand universe of
%	the background knowledge predicates, also ordered by a call to
%	order_constraints/3.
%
%	@tbd It is a little strange that this predicate returns the list
%	of constants, alongside the program signature. Perhaps the call
%	to order_constraints/3 can be be moved outside this predicate,
%	in the body of thelma/5. Then program_signature/3 can take the
%	resutling ordered list of BK predicates, add the symbols of the
%	target predicate and invented predicates to it, and return it.
