/** <module> Examples invention.

Predicates in this module learn programs by generalising positive
examples. A generalised example is entailed by more clauses in the
Hypothesis Language, therefore more general programs can be learned than
with a set of fully-ground examples.

Generalising examples of course introduces a risk of learning
over-general programs. To combat this, negative examples or strictly
relevant background knowledge and metarules are needed.

There are three groups of predicates defined in this module.

1. learn_with_partial_examples/[1,2,5]

These learning predicates partially generalise examples producing a set
of atoms of the target predicates where a constant is replaced with a
variable. For example a positive example p(a,b) yields two partial
examples, p(X,b) and p(a,Y), etc. learn_with_partial_examples/[1,2,5]
then learn a Top Program from the set of partial examples. The Top
Program is reduced _with the original examples_. Reduction with the
partial examples may be over-strong (because the partial examples may be
over-general).

Learning with partial examples can produce clauses that entail no
positive examples. These are removed from the Top Program before
reductin.

2. learn_with_examples_invention/[1,2,5]

These learning predicates first invent a new set of ground examples,
then learn a Top Program with those examples. The learned Top Program is
reduced with respect to the learned ground examples.

3. examples_invention/[1,2,5]

These three predicates perform examples invention. To invent examples,
first a set of partial examples is generated, in the same way described
in section 1 above. Then, a Top Program is constructed from the partial
examples. Finally, the Least Herbrand Model of the Top Program for the
partial examples is derived in a bottom-up fashion. The result is a set
of ground atoms of the learning targets.

4. partial_examples/2

This predicate is responsible for generalising examples by partially
variabilising them.

%
%	The motivation for this is that if we have a target predicate
%	f/2 in Top and this is defined in terms of itself, tabled

%	same result _even when we remove clauses of Top from the dynamic
%	database_. This would completely defeat the purpose of removing
%	clauses to test their necessity to the Top Program's
%	correctness. Declaring target predicates as dynamic and

%	tables when a clause of the Top Program is added to or removed
%	from the dynamic database during execution of remove_null_/4.
