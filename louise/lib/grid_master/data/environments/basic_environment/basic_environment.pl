/** <module> Maze environment.

Predicates to initialise an environment, interact with it, and display
the results.

Needs direction arrows to be declared passable (I think):

passable(r).

%!      environment_init(+Type,+Display,+Dims,-Fluents,-Q0,-O0,-Goal) is
%!      det.
%
%       Initialise a maze environment.
%
%       Typedenotes where the maze map comes from and it can be either a map/3
%       term, or a term id(Id), where Id is an identifier for the map.
%       If Type is a term id(Id) and Id is the identifier of a map/3
%       term in the maps module, then that map is used, otherwise a new
%       maze map is generated using mage/2, and with Id as its
%       identifier.
%
%       Display is one of: [none, print, blessed], denoting how the
%       environment is to be displayed.
%       * none: no display. Not currently implemented.
%       * print: the environment will be displayed at the end of
%         execution with a call to print_path/4.
%       * blassed: the environment will be animated in real time using
%         the blessed Python library to control the terminal. Cannot run
%         in the SWI-Prolog IDE (on windows).
%
%       Dims is a pair W-H, the dimensions of a maze to be generated
%       with mage/2. Has no effect if Type is 'mage'.
%
%       Fluents is a pair Fs-S where Fs is a set of fluents that
%       describe the state of the environment and S is a starting tile
%       matched to a corresponding S variable in Fs. The form of Fs
%       depends on the value of Display:
%       * If Display is 'print', Fs is of the form: [M,X/Y,S], where M
%         is a map/3 term, X/Y the initial location of the agent in the
%         maze and S the symbol at that location.
%       * If Display is 'blessed' an additional element Term is added to
%         the end of Fs, that holds a blessed Terminal() object to be
%         used for display.
%
%       Q0 is the state label for the initial state of a controller
%       exploring the maze.
%
%       O0 is an observation label for the initial observation of a
%       controller exploring the maze.
%
%       Goal is a pair G-E, where G is a list of fluents similar to
%       Fluents with the difference that E is a matched to a variable E,
%       replacing S in Fluents. E can be used to direct a controller to
%       a target tile, e.g. a maze's exit tile.
